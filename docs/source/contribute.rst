Disclaimer: there is only one maintainer for this project, a first-year PhD
student.

Contributing is not accepted. I have no idea how it works, or even if someone
would be interested.
I am coding this for myself and if it helps others, they are welcome to use it.
I am slowly learning and my research work takes priority.
