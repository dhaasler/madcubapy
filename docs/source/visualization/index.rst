Introduction
============

The `madcubapy.visualization` package provides functions that simplify the
process of visualizing data through `astropy`. 
Most of these functions rely on `astropy.visualization` to do most of the work,
and they were created to help the end user plot images with ease by taking care
of several caveats when working with FITS files (e.g dealing with
multidimensional data, or unexpected header parameters).
